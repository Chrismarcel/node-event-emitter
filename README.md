# node-event-emitter

A simple Program to illustrate how Events and Event Emitters work in Node. Culled from Anthony Alicea's Learn and Understand Node Js.

The inspiration for this project was culled from Anthony Alicea's Learn and Understand Node JS tutorial - https://www.udemy.com/understand-nodejs/
Original Program used in the turotial was written with ES5 and Function Constructors
I decided to rewrite it using modern ES6 class syntax.

To run

- Install Node JS
- Clone repo
- run node app

Thanks
